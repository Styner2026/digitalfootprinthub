# 🔧 Main Dashboard Fix Applied!

## ✅ What I Fixed:

**The Issue:** Your main dashboard wasn't using the ElevenLabs agent properly, while the side widget was working perfectly.

**The Fix:** 
1. **Simplified API call** to match the working widget format
2. **Enhanced response parsing** to handle all possible response formats
3. **Detailed logging** to see exactly what's happening
4. **Better error handling** with clear fallback messages

## 🧪 Test Your Main Dashboard Now:

### 1. **Open Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab)

### 2. **Test Main Dashboard:**
- Go to: http://localhost:3000/
- Type in main chat: "investigate John Smith"
- Watch the console for detailed logs

### 3. **Look for These Console Messages:**

**✅ If ElevenLabs is working:**
```
🧠 MAIN DASHBOARD: Attempting ElevenLabs with agent: agent_01jywe6bnhejrvag66br9re2e3
✅ MAIN DASHBOARD: ElevenLabs Success! Full Response: [object]
📝 MAIN DASHBOARD: Found response in [property_name]
✅ MAIN DASHBOARD: Successfully extracted response: Hey! I can definitely help you investigate...
```

**❌ If there's an issue:**
```
❌ MAIN DASHBOARD: ElevenLabs API Error: [error details]
🔄 MAIN DASHBOARD: Will fall back to Cohere AI...
🧠 MAIN DASHBOARD: Using Cohere AI fallback...
```

**⚠️ If credentials are missing:**
```
⚠️ MAIN DASHBOARD: ElevenLabs credentials missing
🔑 MAIN DASHBOARD: Has API key: true/false
🔑 MAIN DASHBOARD: Has Agent ID: true/false
```

## 🎯 Expected Result:

Your main dashboard should now give **the same conversational, natural responses** as your side widget - like this:

> "Hey! I can definitely help you investigate John Smith. Let me look into this for you... This is interesting - I'm finding several different profiles with varying levels of authenticity. Can you tell me a bit more about how you know this person?"

## 🚀 If It's Still Not Working:

Check the console logs and let me know what messages you see. The detailed logging will show us exactly where the issue is!

**Test it now and check the browser console!** 🔍
